## Core Features:

- Website Scan Initiation: Accepts a website URL, initiates a vulnerability scan, and displays a progress bar. Includes real-time logs or activity console.
- Vulnerability Scan: Scans target website using Nmap, OWASP ZAP, Nikto, or custom node modules for vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, XSS, insecure headers, misconfigurations, and open ports.
- AI-Powered Analysis: Analyzes raw scan output, summarizes vulnerabilities, suggests fixes, and prioritizes issues based on severity and context using a large language model. The AI acts as a summarization and analysis tool for interpreting scan data.
- Categorized Results Display: Displays vulnerabilities in a categorized table (High, Medium, Low) with AI-generated descriptions, potential impact, and suggested remediation.
- AI Chat Panel: Enables users to query the AI assistant for explanations and fixes related to the discovered vulnerabilities.
- Report Generation: Generates detailed PDF or CSV reports with charts, severity breakdowns, and AI summaries, downloadable from scan history.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#2E9AFE) for trust and security.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (#EBF4FA) to ensure a clean and trustworthy layout.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined look, ensuring readability across all elements. Use 'Source Code Pro' for display code or CLI commands.
- Use clear, concise icons to represent vulnerability types and severity levels. Use the VigilanteAI logo as the application logo.
- Maintain a clean, tabbed dashboard layout for easy navigation between scan results, AI assistance, and reports.
